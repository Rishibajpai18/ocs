We propose to develop a web page where one can refer to, for the solution of a problem and can also store his or her code on the web page. This would be a great source of information in the field of coding and would be a great help for learners while coding. Existing guidelines for Web usability hinder web-based application usability since they are primarily based on interactions within a browsing metaphor. The main difference is that with traditional in-house software the user only focuses on the application itself. The application is stand-alone, installed on the users system and the IT department or network administrator takes care of the management, monitoring, updates and all other tasks related to using software in a business environment.
